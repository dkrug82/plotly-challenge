An interactive dashboard can be found at the link here:

In this challenge I used d3 and plotly to explore and visualize the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

On this dashboard you will find four types of visualizations for the data that was provided. <br>
•	You will see a table that will give demographics of everyone give a sample.
•	There is a horizontal bar chart showing the top ten bacteria cultures found in each sample.
•	Next is a gauge chart to show the wash frequency of the sample givers belly button.
•	Finally a bubble chart showing the value of each OTU ID.
